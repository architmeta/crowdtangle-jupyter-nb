The term has ancient roots, but one of the earliest records is from 1144. At the time, Christians in England falsely accused Jews of murdering a young boy named William of Norwich and using his blood for religious rituals. Such blood libels claimed that Jews used Christian blood to make Passover matzah. Blood libels have been around for centuries. The Nazis invoked the blood libel during the Holocaust. The term is still used in parts of the Middle East as well. The goal of blood libels is to turn Jews into monsters and thus justify their murder. Historically, blood libels have led to pogroms, expulsions, and genocide. Blood libels almost always ended in the murder of innocent Jews. The same is true right now.

The Western Journal,2024-05-27 12:18:07 EDT,75,"Muslims Turn Against Biden in Key Swing States, Want Democrats to 'Learn a Lesson' Frustrated by what they perceive as the Biden administration‚Äôs pro-Israel stance, some Muslim organizations have decided to actively undermine President Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign, apparently to teach the Democratic Party a lesson. A national ‚ÄúAbandon Biden‚Äù movement aimed at defeating President Biden‚Äôs re-election bid in 2024 is gaining momentum among some Muslim activists and leaders, including several from Minnesota, a state that hasn‚Äôt voted Republican in a presidential election since 1972. Their goal is to punish the president for his stance on the Israeli military offensive in Gazaafter the brutal Oct. 7 assault on Israel by the Palestinian militant group, Hamas. The movement‚Äôs leaders, who say they also oppose former President Donald Trump, acknowledge their efforts could inadvertently help Trump return to power. But they believe sending a message that ‚Äúdefending genocide‚Äù can cost a candidate the presidency is more important, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. ‚ÄúBy defeating [Biden], it would signal to the entire political landscape that defending genocide could lead to your defeat, so beware,‚Äù Hassan Abdel Salam, a University of Minnesota human rights professor who quit teaching to focus on leading Abandon Biden, told the newspaper. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my goal‚Ä¶promote the message throughout the nation and ensure it‚Äôs a consistent one.‚Äù Salam and other Minnesota Muslims launched the campaign after Biden failed to heed their demand that he he call for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza by Oct. 31, less than a month after the barbarous Hamas attack killed about 1,200 Israelis and took more than 200 hostage. While Biden recently paused an arms shipment to Israel, they say it was too little, too late for them. According to Salam, the group is looking for third-party candidates to endorse in the summer. Among the 14 Muslim voters interviewed by the Star Tribune, only three said they would vote for Biden in 2024. One of the men interviewed told the newspaper that the Democratic Party thinks Muslims will vote for Biden because they are scared of Trump. ‚Äú[Trump] will stay four years, but the Democrats will learn a lesson: They‚Äôre going to lose their base if they don‚Äôt listen to the people,‚Äù he said. The group is now active in nine swing states like Georgia, Arizona and Wisconsin where Muslim voters could potentially sway tight races. ‚ÄúOur math right now shows really no pathway for Biden to win,‚Äù Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, told the Star Tribune. Biden got over 30,000 votes from Dearborn alone in 2020 on his way to winning Michigan by 154,000 votes overall. With a tight re-election battle expected, losing substantial Arab American support could badly undermine Biden‚Äôs path to victory in this critical swing state, according to The Washington Post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve squandered the power that we have here for too long because Democrats were stringing us along saying ‚ÄòVote for me, we‚Äôre not the other guy,'‚Äùone Abandon Biden activist told the Post. ‚ÄúThis is such a dangerous time that we‚Äôre finally willing to use that card, and [Biden] thinks we‚Äôre bluffing.‚Äù A poll commissioned by the Arab American Institute in October showed Biden‚Äôs support plummeting among Arab American voters from 59 percent in 2020 to just 17 percent at the time of the survey ‚Äî a staggering 42 percentage point collapse. His approval rating among the constituency also cratered from 74 percent to 29 percent. The poll also showed that two-thirds of Arab Americans have a negative view of the president‚Äôs policies toward the Israel-Gaza conflict. The findings could have major electoral implications, as Arab Americans account for hundreds of thousands of votes in battleground states like Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania that may decide the 2024 outcome, according to a statement by the Arab American Institute. Perhaps most striking, the poll marks the first time in over 26 years that a majority of Arab Americans did not say that they prefer the Democratic Party. Arab Americans have put their hope in the false idol of the Democratic Party, assuming that their faithful allegiance would force the hand of U.S. policy against the enemies of Islamic countries. Fortunately, despite Biden‚Äôs efforts to hold back aid to Israel and his attempts to control Israel‚Äôs ability to destroy its enemies, there are still enough lawmakers within both parties combined who understand the difference between support for a terrorist organization, Hamas, and a Democratic nation, Israel. Now, Muslims in the U.S. are hoping that by helping to defeat Biden, they will bring the Democratic Party to its knees, ready to do their bidding in the future. Their strategy may actually have some long-term merit in that it could increase their power in the win-at-all-costs Democratic Party. But that could simply clarify voting in future elections ‚Äî (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/100064422354515/posts/853926090098128

The Daily Signal,2024-06-25 21:49:02 EDT,50,"BREAKING: Socialist New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman lost in a Democratic primary in New York‚Äôs 16th Congressional District on Tuesday to county executive George Latimer. Bowman is a member of ‚Äúthe Squad,‚Äù an informal group of far-Left Democrat House members. He was endorsed by the Democratic Socialists of America. Fellow Squad member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., appeared at a rally with him in New York on Saturday. Bowman‚Äôs challenger entered the primary in part due to Bowman‚Äôs opposition to Israel and controversial statements he‚Äôs made about Israel‚Äôs war in Gaza. The New York congressman has been critical of Israel, even after the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7. He has accused Israel of committing a genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. At a political rally last November, Bowman questioned whether Hamas terrorists actually raped women or killed babies. ‚ÄúThere was propaganda used in the beginning of the siege,‚Äù Bowman said Nov. 17 at a pro-Palestinian rally, according to a TikTok video reported on by Politico. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still no evidence of beheaded babies or raped women. But they still keep using that lie [for] propaganda.‚Äù After initially refusing to address those comments, Bowman reversed himself and condemned the rapes committed by Hamas. In the weeks and days just before the primary vote, Bowman began to change his stance on the Israel-Palestine issue and apologized for the remarks he made about Hamas not committing rape. ‚ÄúImmediately, when the U.N. provided additional evidence, I voted to condemn the sexual violence,‚Äù Bowman said a week before the election, according to the Hill. ‚ÄúI apologize for my comments, and now, we‚Äôre continuing to do the work to fight sexual violence and domestic violence in all its forms.‚Äù Bowman has had other contentious moments and scandals during his time in office. He was censured by Congress following an incident in which he pulled a fire alarm in a congressional office building just before a House vote in late September. The fire alarm nearly delayed a vote on a continuing resolution that, if not passed, would have shut down part of the government. Bowman said he pulled the alarm by mistake and that he thought the lever was a method to open the door and exit the building.",https://www.facebook.com/100070075128715/posts/762586036087227

The court ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent acts within the scope of the Genocide Convention, to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, and to submit a report within one month on the steps it has taken. The ruling demonstrates the irrefutability of the meticulous, thoroughly reasoned, and detailed case that South Africa made before the ICJ. Working around the clock over three months, South Africa‚Äôs legal team researched, wrote, and laid out the evidence for how Israel‚Äôs industrial-scale slaughter of over 30,000 Palestinians and wholesale destruction of Gaza‚Äôs infrastructure fit all of the criteria necessary to designate Israel‚Äôs campaign as a genocide. Today‚Äôs result should invite measured celebration. Despite Israel and the US‚Äô attempts to spin this ruling in their favor, it reaffirms what we already know about the truth of Zionism in practice, and it demonstrates that, in an increasingly multipolar world, international institutions are capable of bending where they previously would not have budged under the weight of Western imperial hegemony. From the founding of the UN at the close of World War II to the turn of the twenty-first century, the US empire and its imperialist allies have virtually ensured that a result such as today‚Äôs would not be possible, in order to protect the Zionist project and allow it to advance. The US‚Äô inability to prevent today‚Äôs result offers proof that the tides are turning‚Äînot only in the streets, where Palestine has long held international favor‚Äîbut in the halls of international institutions that are beginning to reflect a new geopolitical reality. Today‚Äôs decision does not mean that there will be a ceasefire or an actual end to genocide, which further demonstrates the limitations of international institutions. Nonetheless, the ICJ‚Äôs ruling will aid in isolating Israel on the international stage and imposing additional roadblocks against Israel. These are welcome developments that, as with Apartheid in South Africa, will hasten the fall of Zionism.",https://www.facebook.com/100064479708447/posts/765839415575375

Judge Andrew Napolitano,2023-11-22 19:02:55 EST,113,"Genocide or Mass Murder?"" This is no trivial question, nor an easy one to answer. Today, our guest, Professor #Mearsheimer forces us to confront this uncomfortable inquiry in relation to the current crisis unfolding in Gaza. With the unsettling language emanating from Israeli elites, #mearsheimer brings to light the alarming realities on the battleground, leading to concerns of potentially genocidal intent. While we are not asserting that genocide is being committed, we underline the gravity of mass murder and the potential for situations to spiral dangerously. We then pivot into dissecting the distinction between genocide and mass murder or #warcrimes‚Äîa pivotal differentiation that has profound implications. In our analysis, we scrutinize the troubling rhetoric from members of the Israeli cabinet, while distinguishing between genocidal intent and the act of genocide. We navigate the inconsistent enforcement of international law and its selective application. This episode challenges us all to consider the depths of war crimes, #genocide, and their impacts.

The targeting of Yemen by the US and UK is a deliberate attempt to reinforce imperialist domination in Yemen and the region at large. Nearly 100 days into Israel‚Äôs genocide against Gaza, and in response to popular masses taking to the streets to call for a ceasefire, the US and UK governments have responded with more war and violence, demonstrating time and again that they would rather mobilize their military might to protect imperialist interests than serve the masses. Despite the millions that have taken to the streets between the US and UK, these governments continue to punish the few brave nations that dare to stop the wheels of Israel‚Äôs genocidal operation against our people in Gaza, which has killed over 30,000 Palestinians in the last three months. This aggression‚Äîwhich coincides with the first day of ICJ hearings on Israel‚Äôs genocide in Gaza‚Äîaffirms the complicity of Western nations, not only in funding and orchestrating this genocide, but also in expanding war into the broader region. We also see this escalation for exactly what it is: a desperate attempt to distract from the colossal military failures of the zionist entity by expanding the war. At a time when other Arab regimes have normalized with Israel, the resistance of the people of Yemen reminds us of the Arab dimension of our struggle and the unity of our people. We have a critical role to play in the diaspora to place pressure on our governments to end the Zionist-imperialist aggression against our people across the region. We salute Yemen's steadfastness and stand unequivocally against all imperialist efforts to stop the rising global tide against colonial cruelty, wherever we may encounter it.

TCD Dearborn News,2024-04-05 14:48:01 EDT,50,"(News & Information Only) the imams and leadership from nearly a dozen mosques across the Greater Detroit area, including Dearborn, Dearborn Heights, Melvindale, Warren, and other locales, have declared the cancellation of all public festivities and celebrations of Eid al-Fitr this year, which is set to fall on Wednesday, April 10, 2024. Eid al-Fitr, a joyous occasion marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan, will be observed differently this year out of deep respect for the innocent victims in the Holy Land, particularly in Gaza. The decision comes in light of the ongoing atrocities and humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza. The imams have collectively agreed to dedicate the Eid sermon to addressing the plight of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, against the backdrop of what they describe as an ongoing genocide and the targeting of aid workers. ‚ÄúThe grave injustice of our time cannot be overlooked,‚Äù said one of the imams, emphasizing the community‚Äôs solidarity with the people of Gaza. ‚ÄúOur conscience does not permit us to engage in celebration while we are fully aware of the genocide of our fellow human beings in Gaza and the butchering of those who go to aid them,‚Äù the statement continued. As a result, the usual festivities will be forgone, with a focus instead on raising awareness about the dire situation in Gaza. In lieu of traditional Eid celebrations, the imams urge all Islamic Centers to dedicate their donations on the day of Eid to the people of Gaza.

Principles NOT Parties,2024-07-06 18:57:41 EDT,100,"King Ahab & Naboth's vineyard An official declaration by Apartheid Israel that it is stealing more land in the Jordan Valley. It is designating land that belonged to Palestinians as ""state property,"" which allows the land to be leased to Zionist Israelis and prevents Christians and Muslims from owning their own land... The size of the area designated is the largest since the (1993) Oslo Accords, and the year 2024 marks a peak seizure of stolen land, said Peace Now, an Israeli human rights organization based in Tel Aviv, that has tracked the growth of illegal Israeli settlements for decades. The group reported that the land would connect settlements in an area along the Jordan border and make a Palestinian state there impossible. Israel could have had peace & security at anytime. There was nothing they needed to negotiate with anyone. They could have withdrawn from the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip Prison Camp to allow an independent nation to be established; or extended human & democratic rights to all. Israel gained control over the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Golan Heights, and the Gaza Strip when it attacked its neighbors in 1967. They attacked the United States at the same time. They planned to sink the U.S.S. Liberty & blame it on Egypt. Israel severely damaged the ship, killed 34 of our sailors, and injured 171. The ship didn't sink & Israel's duplicity was found out. Since then, Israel has built settlements throughout the West Bank, where more than 750,000 Israelis trespassers live. These settlements are illegal under international law. About 3 million Palestinians live in the West Bank, some in places administered by the Palestinian Authority. But much of the West Bank is off-limits to the authority despite the Christians and Muslims living there. They are denied basic human rights, water rights, & not allowed to vote for representation in The Knesset - ◊î◊õ◊†◊°◊™. The Israeli government announced that it has stolen more than 23.7 square kilometers of land in the West Bank since the beginning of this year. The newly taken land is in a place where settler violence was displacing communities of Palestinians even before October 7th. The U.S. Department of State found systematic human rights violations by Israel in the West Bank prior to Hamas' prison outbreak on October 7th. Hamas violently seized settlers to trade for thousands of hostages held by Israel; escalating the war Israel began in 1948. State violence is used to expand Israeli control over large areas and diminishes the likelihood of achieving a Palestinian state. Israel's rapid growth in the West Bank shows how influential the settler community is in the government of Benjamin Netanyahu - ◊ë◊†◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊†◊™◊†◊ô◊î◊ï. Netanyahu boasted many times that Israel's support for Hamas blocked a two-state solution or extending human & democratic rights to all. Israel helped establish, finance & arm Hamas. When Israel turned Gaza into a prison in 2005, they brought in Hamas to run it for them. Hamas was hated by most of the Christian and Muslim refugees imprisoned there. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who is also a settler, has accelerated the land theft. He has taken new powers to develop settlements and aims to strengthen Israel's control over the land in the ongoing genocide of Christians and Muslims in Palestine. It's heresy in Judaism and Christianity to conflate the modern state of Israel, founded by non-religious Zionists, with the biblical Israel or the New Jerusalem to be established by the Messiah. Israel's founders and all of its Prime Ministers have been secular Zionists; not believers in Judaism. Most ultra-Orthodox Jews, in Israel & abroad are anti-Zionists.

As massive crowds formed along food aid routes on al-Rashid street in Gaza City, desperately trying to find food, Occupation tanks began firing on civilians; a horrific massacre resulting in at least 100 martyrs and hundreds more wounded. Israeli military vehicles trampled the bodies of the victims, preventing first responders from reaching them. This massacre is but a continuation of the war of annihilation waged against the Palestinians of Gaza who are being left to starve across their besieged land. Even without food, water, or shelter, the Palestinian people in Gaza continue to be targets for the criminal Occupation forces who attempt to compensate for their failures on the battlefield by massacring civilians. The massacres committed against the people of Gaza have clarified to the world that the depravity of Zionism knows no limits, and masses have mobilized across the world in defense of the Palestinian people. The policy of starvation used by the Israeli forces must be condemned in the strongest terms by the world, which has been witnessing the eradication of an entire people over the past four months. Israel would not be able to continue in its genocide against Gaza were it not for the unlimited support and cover offered by Western powers, especially the US, making them directly complicit in these crimes. We reiterate our most urgent demand for a ceasefire and for the provision of food and other aid into Gaza, without it being targeted by blood thirsty Occupation forces. We reiterate that the funders of this genocide must also be held accountable and it is our responsibility to stop the funding and arming of this criminal Occupation that wages war against the men, women, and children of Gaza.",https://www.facebook.com/100064479708447/posts/786000650225918

The court ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent acts within the scope of the Genocide Convention, to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, and to submit a report within one month on the steps it has taken. The ruling demonstrates the irrefutability of the meticulous, thoroughly reasoned, and painstakingly detailed case that South Africa made before the ICJ. Working around the clock over three months, South Africa‚Äôs legal team researched, wrote, and laid out the evidence for why Israel‚Äôs industrial-scale slaughter of over 30,000 Palestinians and wholesale destruction of Gaza‚Äôs infrastructure fit all of the criteria necessary to designate Israel‚Äôs campaign as a genocide. Today‚Äôs result should invite measured celebration. It reaffirms what we already know about the truth of Zionism in practice, and it demonstrates that, in an increasingly multipolar world, international institutions are capable of bending where they previously would not have budged under the weight of Western imperial hegemony. From the founding of the UN at the close of World War II to the turn of the twenty-first century, the US empire and its imperialist allies have virtually ensured that a result such as today‚Äôs would not be possible, in order to protect the Zionist project and allow it to advance. The US‚Äô inability to prevent today‚Äôs result offers proof that the tides are turning‚Äînot only in the streets, where Palestine has long held international favor‚Äîbut in the halls of international institutions that are beginning to reflect a new geopolitical reality. Importantly, today‚Äôs decision does not mean that there will be a ceasefire. It remains to be seen how the UN will enforce sanctions to be later imposed against Israel. Still, the ICJ‚Äôs ruling will aid in isolating Israel on the international stage and imposing additional roadblocks against Israel.

The Arab American News,2024-04-02 23:55:48 EDT,20,"A Palestinian American doctor walked out of a meeting with President Joe Biden before it was over Tuesday evening, underscoring the high tensions, anger and concern from Arab, Palestinian and Muslim American communities amid the Israeli war on Gaza. Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an emergency physician from Chicago who traveled to Gaza earlier this year, told CNN he abruptly left the meeting that included Vice President Kamala Harris, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, other administration officials and a small group of Muslim community leaders. While the president has often faced protests and interruptions at public events in the last several months, Ahmad‚Äôs decision to leave the meeting is perhaps the most intimate moment of protest the president has faced to date since Israel‚Äôs genocidal campaign on Gaza began. What was supposed to be an iftar dinner to break the Ramadan fast was changed to a meeting because participants didn‚Äôt feel comfortable having a celebratory meal while hundreds of thousands in Gaza are on the brink of famine. It‚Äôs another example of the administration‚Äôs fraying relationship with the Muslim American community ‚Äî other attempts at holding meetings in key states have been hampered by declined invitations, and relationships with important community groups have frayed since the war began. Following the meeting, a White House official said in a statement that ‚ÄúPresident Biden and Vice President Harris know this is a deeply painful moment for many in the Muslim and Arab communities.‚Äù Ahmad traveled to Gaza as part of a delegation of doctors from the NGO MedGlobal, working in the city of Khan Younis as fighting raged around the Nasser Hospital. ‚ÄúI said it was disappointing I‚Äôm the only Palestinian here, and out of respect for my community, I‚Äôm going to leave,‚Äù Ahmad said he told the president. Before he left, he handed Biden a letter from an eight-year-old orphaned girl, Hadeel, who is living in Rafah. #grnocideingaza #genocidejoe #thearabamericannews",https://www.facebook.com/100043117668766/posts/1168257761288135

Dr. Hani was remembered by all as a loving, caring, brilliant physician with a fatherly presence and a remarkably steadfast demeanor.

The resolution comes after Israel has bombed, besieged, and destroyed the majority of Gaza over a six-month period, massacring over 40,000 Palestinians including more than 15,000 children. The resolution calls for a ceasefire ‚Äúat least‚Äù until the end of Ramadan, alluding only to a hope for a more ‚Äúlasting‚Äù ceasefire after that. The word ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù was taken out last minute as the US interfered in the drafting process, such that UNSC members barely had time to read the final iteration before casting their vote. For the first time ever, the US did not use its veto power to block a Palestine-related resolution at the UNSC, instead abstaining from the resolution vote. Shortly after the US abstained, Benjamin Netanyahu called off a high-level delegation of Israeli officials who were set to meet with US politicians in Washington this week. Despite withholding its veto, the US was still the only UNSC member to abstain from voting. The Biden Administration and leading US politicians of both major parties have also recommitted to defunding UNRWA, depriving millions of Palestinian refugees of their single largest funding source for food, shelter, and healthcare across Gaza, Palestine, and the Greater Levant. The ceasefire resolution fundamentally falls short of the Palestinian resistance and people‚Äôs demands. Those demands include a permanent ceasefire, the liberation of all Palestinian political prisoners from Zionist prisons, full withdrawal of Zionist forces from Gaza, and a lifting of the siege. Despite our movement‚Äôs symbolic progress on the international stage, the US and its allies continue to materially support Israel in its genocide through unconditional provision of billions of dollars in weapons, bombs, and military technology. Until Western complicity in Zionism ends, a ceasefire resolution is unlikely to have much of an impact on the genocide itself. With Land Day approaching, now is the time to concentrate our energies and focus on ending Western complicity ‚Äî not only diplomatically, but materially.
